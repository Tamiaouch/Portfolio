### Model_Comparison (Python)
Participated in a Kaggle-style machine learning competition where I developed and optimized models for a classification task. The objective was the train models with two different methods (logistic regression and random forest trees) set with different hyperparamters to evaluate what trained model performed best on unseen data.
### Unemployment (QGIS)
Visualize csv data to create a choropleth map of the unemployment population in Washington with a dot density layer of locations with high POC population in King County, making it efficient to analyze connection between POC communities and Unemployment.
### Music Playlist (Java)
Allows the user to add and play songs, print or clear out their song history, and delete specific songs from their history. Implements Stacks, Queues, and Lists.
### TodoList Manager (Java)
Allows user to create a todolist, mark things as completed, and assign due dates. Implements lists 
### Twitter Trends (Java)
Replicates twitter allowing the user to add tweets, access the count of their tweets, find their least and most frequent word used, and delete tweets of their choosing. Application implements the List interface, uses variable declaration and method calls
### a1-protests (R)
**Protest data using StringR package.** 
Download CSV file from url link, make analysis using rmin, rmax, Nrow, ncol, median, mean 
Goal: find a connection between which area had higher population of protests and what protests were most common 
### a2-covid (R)
**Covid analysis using dplyr package**
Download CSV file from command line computer path 
Used commands like filter, summarize, and group by to understand the deaths and cases reported per state
Goal: find which states had higher COVID rates, and if deaths were correlated with higher population 
### a3-spl-checkouts (R)
**Library Checkouts using ggplot**
Download csv file from raw GitHub data 
Used commands like left and right join, ggplot and geom_line 
Goal: combine categories from particular checkouts I wanted to study. Find trends in which books were popular and publish it to a markdown file with the summaries of trends I found to make the author understand what topics to expand on 
### a4-climate-change (R)
**Climate Change in the Philippines using plotly and shinyapp**
Download csv file using raw GitHub data 

Communicated between the server and UI to publish the charts I created using ggplot and render commands like pull, summarize and pivot 

The charts were able to be changed based on the widgets I created and showed what specific features contributed most to the CO2 levels in the Philippines 

Goal: understand using data visualizations and helpful widgets to share with the client what would contribute most to lessening CO2 production
